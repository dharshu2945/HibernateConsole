HibernateConsole is a backend-focused Java console application built using Hibernate ORM to manage persistent data in a relational database. The project demonstrates the implementation of object-relational mapping (ORM) principles by mapping Java entity classes to database tables using annotations.

Key features include:

Implementation of full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Configuration of Hibernate using hibernate.cfg.xml

Usage of SessionFactory, Session, and Transaction APIs

Entity mapping using annotations like @Entity, @Table, @Id, etc.

Integration with a relational database (e.g., MySQL/Oracle)

Proper exception handling and database transaction management

Modular DAO structure for clean separation of concerns

This project showcases understanding of:

ORM architecture

Database connectivity
